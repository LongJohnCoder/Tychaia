Tychaia
=======

An openly developed, procedurally generated infinite RPG.

*This game is __not__ open source software!*  While it is openly developed, it might not be a freeware game.  We're still in early stages of development, so we have yet to determine an appropriate license.

About
--------

Imagine a game where the world never ends, the scale is infinite and there's always one more quest.  Where the game starts with nothing and ends with your death.  Welcome to Tychaia.

There's still a lot of work to be done regarding the game's procedural generation, such as:
  * Biomes
  * Dungeons
  * Regions
  * Towns
  * Items
  * Enemies
  * NPC and Family Tree Generation
  * Backstory Generation
  * Quest Generation
